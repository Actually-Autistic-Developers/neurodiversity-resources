# neurodiversity-resources
A collection of workings on neurodiversity

Hey there, 

I'm NOT a DR. I am however a humxn being who is Autistic Af who knows that the world made a lot more sense to me after I took the time to learn about my own behaviors. 
I am compiling some of the resources that have helped me come to understand many of my unique co-morbidities and get aligned with how I want to show up in the world despite my neuro-differences. My differences are only unique to me in the ways that they manifest...a great deal of the population is in fact neurodivergent, many are unaware.

Our culture is not the best with communication, some of the truths about our brains have ended up in many books, but the narrative is full of bias. 
  + This repo is in an effort to spare spoons and streamline the learning process. 
  + There is a lot of SHITE on the internet about our "disorders" and undesirable behaviors, I won't be posting any of that energy here. 
 
> The idea here is that if you read a document within this repository and a good deal of it resonates...you may me on the Spectrum of Neurodivergence. 
> 
> Tune in and find out where!
>
> Self Diagnosis is valid. 
> 
> Impostor syndrome is almost inevitable and a clear (to me) byproduct of ableism.
> 
> Validation is crucial. 
> 
> You are loved. ❤️

**My Autism Spectrum**
```
Neurological
```
+ Sensory processing disorder
+ ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)
+ Synesthesia (Simply put, when one sense is activated, another unrelated sense is activated at the same time, sometimes many all at once. Fun Fact: Billie Eillish experiences this!
+ Echolalia (I repeat the words, movements and actions of others when they appears soothing to me, it is almost reflexive)
```
Psychological
```
+ Mutism (It is NOT selective, no ones mutism is by choice) 
+ Alexithymia (emotional processing / "big feelings") 
+ Anxiety Induced Food Avoidance
+ C-PTSD (Complex Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome) it's the upgrade from the basic edition
+ OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) 
+ PDA (Pathological extreme demand avoidance)
+ Bipolar
```
Learning Differences
```
+ Dyslexia (difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbols)
+ Dyscalculia (math problems)
+ Hyperlexia (reading savant) - I still read to a wicked degree, but the letters still hop around on the page 
```
Physiological (“co-occuring conditions”) 
```
+ Hyperacusis (Sensitive Hearing) - 🎧 I wear Headphones Everywhere, Spotify is everything.
+ Dyspraxia (coordination problems) - I OUTGREW this ya'll I obsessed over balance since a child, I walk tight ropes now. 
+ Vision Problems (various, lightly explored...finally have 👓)
```
Genetics 
```
+ Gender Spectrum (Transgender/non conforming) (I prefer the term Autigender which is a Neurogender)
  + `Autigender` - My sensory processing disorder makes it so my environment impacts my genders manifestation.
