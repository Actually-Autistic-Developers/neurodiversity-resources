> Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder that can cause above-normal levels of hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. 

☝🏾 according to people who have observed us

...I will do my best to share our experiences and in our own words.  

Hey there, 

I'm NOT a DR. I am however a humxn being who is Autistic Af, my ADHD is an obstacle at every single descision or thought point. The world made a lot more sense when I took the time to learn about my own behaviors. I am compiling some of the resources that have helped me come to understand many of my unique co-morbidities and get aligned with how I want to show up in the world despite my differences. My differences are only unique to me in the ways that they manifest...a great deal of the population is in fact neurodiverse, many are unaware.

Our culture is not the best with communication, some of the truths about ADHD have ended up in books alongside a great deal of bias. 
  + This repo is in an effort to spare spoons and streamline the learning process. 
  + There is a lot of SHITE on the internet on the topic, I won't be posting any of that here. 

The idea is if you read this document and a good deal of it resonates...you may have ADHD (ADHD is a spectrum you may be a lil or a lot, find your truth)
> Self Diagnosis is valid, impostor syndrome is inevitable and a byproduct of ableism : Validation is crucial. You are loved.



### My ADHD and my relationship with food:

### In honor of our spectrum I will include some of the ADHD communities responses to this meme :

- [ ] All of this, except eating too quickly, I'm a VERY slow eater. But that's sometimes because I'm too busy talking, so still ADHD 😉
- [ ] Burning OR undercooking OR getting started cooking and realizing halfway in you are missing key ingredients.
- [ ] Buying food and not being able to use it before it goes bad due to object permanence issues and other shenanigans.
- [ ] Buying things with the intention of cooking and then throwing out rotting veggies a week later...
- [ ] Yeah this is the biggest problem I have with my meds, I accidentally lose weight all the time because I straight up forget about food.
- [ ] All my food needs to be B U R N E D, or I won’t eat it 🔥.
- [ ] Forgetting to eat for 2 days.
> Survival mode : When I am under high levels of stress or anxiety I have what I call an *anxiety induced food avoidance*. I'm not hungry AND the idea sounds awful. My environment activates the trauma in my body and my brain thinks were in a battle. Folx don't eat in a fight. Sometimes life just feels like a neverending battle? -Aloysious 

1. You ate that burger so fast, you ate it so fast the whole red robin is looking at you.
2. You started eating like a normal person but then you started talking or daydreaming and now the waitress is handing you a check but you still have half a plate of cold food.
3. You were going to go out and eat, but then you saw a video in your youtube recommendation that drew you towards it like a moth to a flame, and now it's 10pm and you've got an empty bag of tortilla chips in your hand and shame in your heart.
4. Mac and cheese
5. You got engrossed in a project, suddenly you feel like you are going to die, faint or both? Oh. You're hungry.
6. You're hungry. But every food you can think of sounds disgusting. Time for your 15th day of lunchables for breakfast in a row.
